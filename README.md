# Defence-in-Depth (Notes, Labs, and Revision Material)

This repository contains my **Defence-in-Depth course work**, including **labs, configurations, answers, and the revision material I created** for exam preparation.  
It’s built as a practical reference: learn → configure → verify → revise.

## What’s Inside

### 1) Revision Material (Created by Me)
This is the main value of the repo — compiled revision resources that summarize key topics and CLI patterns.

Typical revision content includes:
- Core security concepts explained in simple terms
- “What to configure” + “how to verify” command sets
- Common mistakes and troubleshooting notes
- Exam-focused summaries for quick review

Look for files/folders such as:
- **Pre-Exam / Revision PDFs** 
- **Revision folders** 
- Quick reference notes, checklists, or command sheets

---

### 2) Weekly Labs & Exercises
Hands-on labs organized by topic/week. Each section usually contains:
- Config notes (CLI)
- Verification commands (`show`, `debug`, ping tests, etc.)
- Short explanations of what the configuration achieves

Topics commonly covered:
- Securing network devices
- AAA (Authentication, Authorization, Accounting)
- Firewall technologies
- IPS/IDS concepts
- LAN security (switch hardening, segmentation)
- VPN technologies (Site-to-Site / remote access concepts)
- ASA-related labs (where applicable)

---

### 3) Topology / Build Notes
Some files explain how the lab topology was created and structured (useful if you’re rebuilding in EVE-NG).

## How to Use This Repo

### If you’re studying Defence-in-Depth:
1. Start with the **Revision Material** (fast overview + exam focus).
2. Jump into the matching **week/topic lab folder**.
3. Rebuild and verify the lab using your simulator.
4. Use the verification notes to confirm behavior.

### If you’re reviewing my work:
- Revision files show my understanding and exam preparation approach.
- Lab folders show implementation + verification.

## Tools / Environment
- EVE-NG (main environment)
- Cisco CLI (routing/switching and security labs)
- Verification-driven troubleshooting (packet flow + show/debug)
